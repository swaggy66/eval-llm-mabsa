Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves identifying specific entities (such as a person, product, service, or experience) mentioned in a text and determining the sentiment expressed toward each entity. Each entity is associated with a sentiment that can be [positive, negative, or neutral].

Your task is to:

1. Identify the entity with a sentiment mentioned in the given text. If there are no sentiment-bearing entities, the output should be empty list.
2. For each identified entity, determine the sentiment in the label set (positive, negative, or neutral).

Example Output format:

[
